# ReFrame test suite for CARC systems

## Purpose

CARC uses [ReFrame](https://github.com/reframe-hpc/reframe) for the following regression testing:

- Module loading
- Job submission (single-node and multi-node)
- File system access and I/O performance
- Data downloads
- Programming environments (compilers, MPI libraries, toolchains, etc.)
- Applications (Python, R, etc.)
- Parallel computing (OpenMP, MPI, CUDA)
- License server access

The tests emphasize functionality and not performance or benchmarking.
